A file compression and decompression tool

# 🗜️ File Compressor in C++

This is a simple file compression and decompression tool built in C++ to demonstrate basic file handling and data manipulation. It is designed to be easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## 🔧 Features

- Compresses a plain text file and outputs a compressed binary file.
- Decompresses the binary file back to the original text.
- Modular code with separate `compress` and `decompress` modules.
- Command-line interface.
- Platform-independent (tested on Windows with CMake and CLion).
## 🛠️ Getting Started
Going to use compression algorithms like Huffman

./file_compresser compress <input_file> <output_file>
./file_compresser decompress <input_file> <output_file>
